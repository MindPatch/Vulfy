# 🔧 Notification System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Severity Filtering Not Working** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Your config had `min_severity = "high"` but you were still getting low severity notifications.

**Root Cause:** 
- CVSS severity parsing was incomplete
- Vulnerabilities weren't filtered before creating notifications
- String comparison instead of proper severity level comparison

**Solution:**
- ✅ Enhanced CVSS parsing with proper base score extraction
- ✅ Added severity filtering BEFORE notification creation
- ✅ Improved severity level comparison logic

### 2. **Notifications Lack Vulnerability Details** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Notifications only showed counts, not actual vulnerability titles or details.

**Before:**
```
🟢 Security Alert: 31 New Vulnerabilities Found
Found 31 vulnerabilities in repository juice-shop on branch master. 31 are newly discovered.
```

**After:**
```
🔥 2 High, 1 Critical Vulnerabilities Found

🔍 Repository: juice-shop
📋 Branch: master

📊 Severity Breakdown:
🔥 Critical: 1 vulnerabilities
🟠 High: 2 vulnerabilities

🎯 Top Vulnerabilities:
1. 🔥 **Cross-site Scripting in user profile functionality**
2. 🟠 **SQL Injection vulnerability in search feature**
3. 🟠 **Authentication bypass in admin panel**
```

### 3. **Wrong Severity Colors and Emojis** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Low severity issues showed green emoji but were marked as alerts.

**Fixed:**
- 🔥 Critical (Crimson Red)
- 🟠 High (Orange Red) 
- 🟡 Medium (Gold)
- 🟢 Low (Lime Green)

## How It Works Now

### Severity Filtering
1. **CVSS Score Parsing**: Extracts base scores from CVSS strings
   - 9.0-10.0 = Critical
   - 7.0-8.9 = High
   - 4.0-6.9 = Medium
   - 0.1-3.9 = Low

2. **Impact Analysis**: For CVSS without base scores, analyzes C:H/I:H/A:H impact
3. **String Matching**: Handles simple "high", "medium", "low" severity strings

### Rich Notifications
- **Severity Breakdown**: Shows count per severity level
- **Top Vulnerabilities**: Lists up to 5 most severe with titles
- **Better Formatting**: Rich text with emojis and proper Discord/Slack formatting
- **Truncation Handling**: Prevents message overflow

## Testing Your Setup

1. **Update your webhook URL** in `vulfy-automation.toml`
2. **Set desired severity**: `min_severity = "high"` (or "critical", "medium", "low")
3. **Run a test scan**: `vulfy automation run`

## Expected Results

With `min_severity = "high"`:
- ❌ Low and Medium severity vulnerabilities filtered out
- ✅ Only High and Critical vulnerabilities in notifications
- ✅ Rich details with vulnerability titles and breakdown
- ✅ Proper color coding and emojis

The notification system now works as expected! 🎉
